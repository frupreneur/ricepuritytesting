          TAKE RICE PURITY TEST
        </Link>
        <p>Have you heard of the Rice Purity Test? It's a survey that's been around since the 1980s and is taken by college students to gauge their level of "purity" based on their answers to a series of questions. The questions cover a range of topics including drug and alcohol use, sexual behavior, and personal beliefs. But does taking the Rice Purity Test really determine your character? Let's take a closer look.</p>
<h2>What is the Rice Purity Test?</h2>
<p>The Rice Purity Test is a survey that originated at Rice University in Houston, Texas. It's a self-assessment tool that measures a person's "purity" based on their responses to a series of questions. The test includes 100 questions that cover a variety of topics including drug and alcohol use, sexual behavior, and personal beliefs.</p>
<h2>How is the Rice Purity Test scored?</h2>
<p>The Rice Purity Test is scored on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the least pure and 100 being the most pure. The higher your score, the more "pure" you are deemed to be. However, it's important to note that the test is not a scientifically validated measure of character or morality. It's simply a fun survey that's been around for decades.</p>
<h2>Does the Rice Purity Test really determine your character?</h2>
<p>The short answer is no. The Rice Purity Test is not a reliable measure of a person's character or morality. It's simply a survey that's meant to be taken for fun. Your score on the test does not define you as a person, and it's important to remember that people can change over time. Just because you may have scored lower on the test in the past does not mean that you can't strive to improve yourself and your behavior.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The Rice Purity Test is a fun survey that's been around for decades, but it's not a reliable measure of a person's character or morality. Your score on the test does not define you as a person, and it's important to remember that people can change over time. So take the test for fun if you want, but don't put too much stock in the results.</p>
