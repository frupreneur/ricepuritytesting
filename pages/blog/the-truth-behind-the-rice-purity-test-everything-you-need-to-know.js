<p>If you’re a student or a recent graduate, you’ve probably heard of the Rice Purity Test. This test is a series of 100 questions that ask about various experiences and behaviors, and it’s often taken as a rite of passage among young adults. But what is the Rice Purity Test, and why is it so popular? In this article, we’ll dive into the history of the test, its purpose, and what it really means for those who take it.</p>
<h2>What is the Rice Purity Test?</h2>
<p>The Rice Purity Test is a survey that asks about experiences and behaviors that may be considered “taboo” or “risqué”. It was originally created in the 1980s by students at Rice University in Houston, Texas, as a way to gauge the “purity” of their classmates. Since then, the test has become popular among college students and young adults as a way to measure their own experiences and compare them to others.</p>
<h2>How does the test work?</h2>
<p>The test consists of 100 questions that ask about a variety of experiences, such as sexual activity, drug use, and criminal behavior. Each question is answered with a “yes” or “no”. Once the test-taker has completed all 100 questions, their score is calculated based on how many “yes” answers they gave. The higher the score, the less “pure” they are considered to be.</p>
<h2>What is the purpose of the test?</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Rice Purity Test is not to shame or judge those who take it. Instead, it’s meant to be a fun and lighthearted way for young adults to explore and compare their experiences. It’s also a way to spark conversations and build connections among peers who may have shared experiences.</p>
<h2>What does the score mean?</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that the score on the Rice Purity Test is not a reflection of someone’s worth or character. It’s simply a measure of their experiences and behaviors. While some may take pride in having a “pure” score, others may find it amusing to have a high score. Ultimately, the score is up to interpretation and should not be taken too seriously.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Rice Purity Test is a popular survey among young adults that measures experiences and behaviors. While it may be considered a rite of passage, it’s important to remember that the score is not a reflection of someone’s worth. Instead, it’s meant to be a fun and lighthearted way to explore and compare experiences with peers.</p>
