        <h2>What is the Rice Purity Test?</h2>
        <p>
          The Rice Purity Test is a self-assessment tool that helps individuals
          understand their level of purity and innocence based on their life
          experiences. The test consists of 100 questions that cover a wide
          range of topics such as sexual behavior, drug and alcohol use, and
          criminal activities. Each question is assigned a score, and at the end
          of the test, the scores are added up to determine the test taker's
          purity score.

        <h2>Why Do People Take the Rice Purity Test?</h2>
        <p>
          People take the Rice Purity Test for various reasons. Some take it out
          of curiosity to see how they compare to others, while others take it
          as a way to reflect on their life experiences and make positive
          changes. Some universities and colleges also use the test as a tool to
          educate their students on responsible behavior.

        <h2>What Does Your Rice Purity Test Score Mean?</h2>
        <p>
          While the Rice Purity Test is not scientifically validated and should
          not be taken as a definitive measure of one's purity, it can provide
          insight into one's life experiences and behaviors. A high score
          (closer to 100) indicates a higher level of innocence and purity,
          while a lower score (closer to 0) indicates a higher level of
          experience and potentially risky behavior.
